	    	<h2>Unfortunately, there may come a time when you are faced with the tough decision of <del>where</del> <ins>whether</ins> or not to move your loved one into a nursing home. If they have a health condition that requires daily medical care, a skilled nursing facility might be the best option. </h2>
	    	<h3>Uprooting a loved one from the familiarity and comfort of the only home they have known for years can cause depression. Aside from being a huge change, many seniors fear moving into a nursing home because they see it as a final step before the end of their life. This is usually true, since they typically do not return to their own home. Living in a nursing home can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation, a primary cause of poor health among <dfn>older adults</dfn>. </h3>
	    	<h4>We’ve all heard horror stories of poor treatment and neglect of nursing home residents. And, in fact, some reports show up to 90 percent of nursing homes are understaffed, which can cause poor supervision and increase the risk of accidents. However, most reputable nursing homes provide superior services and thoughtful care. </h4>

	    	<h6>Depending on where you live, there might not be a quality nursing home facility located close by. A long drive to visit on the weekends can take a toll on family members over time. Even if you are able to visit regularly, your loved one may still feel a lack of family presence, increasing feelings of loneliness and depression. Most nursing home staff do their best to build a sense of community among residents, but for seniors they’re still not family.</h6>
